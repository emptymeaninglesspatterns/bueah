# seo's eww config

This repository serves the purpose of a backup more than a showcase (or atleast that's how it is right now).

The structure of the configurations is as follows:
- `eww.yuck`: contains the main `defwindow` statements
- `modules.yuck`: contains all of the widgets
- `eww.scss`: contains all of the styling for the widgets
- `scripts`: some scripts that are used by widgets

Again, I would like to note that this is not, at all, quality code. It (probably) has a lot of inconsistencies that I, honestly, am not mentally prepared to deal with.

If you do find something and have a solution / idea on how I could solve it, feel free to open an issue! Feedback is always appreciated.
