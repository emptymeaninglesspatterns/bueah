# seo's eww config

This repository serves the purpose of a backup more than a showcase (or atleast that's how it is right now).

The structure of the configurations is as follows:
- `eww.yuck`: contains the main `defwindow` statements
- `modules.yuck`: contains all of the widgets
- `eww.scss`: contains all of the styling for the widgets
- `scripts`: some scripts that are used by widgets
